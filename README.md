# hangnam-game
For this task, I developed a classic Hangman game. The program randomly selects a word, and the player guesses one letter at a time to uncover the hidden word. With each incorrect guess, the player gets closer to running out of attempts. It's a fun and challenging way to sharpen my Python skills and learn about game development basics.
